## Iteration One:
### As a player in game, I want to be able to tap the screen to jump onto platforms, so that I can reach objectives and avoid obstacles.
a) Given that I am in game moving towards a platform, when I tap the screen, then I should move upwards and then fall towards a platform, and when it looks like I should fall to rest on a platform, then I should land on that platform.

b) Given that I am in game moving towards a platform, when I tap the screen, then I should move upwards and then fall towards a platform, and when it looks like I shouldn’t fall to rest on a platform, then I should fall back to the ground.

c) Given that I am in game and a platform is above me, when I tap the screen, then I should move upwards and will land on the platform

### As a player, I want to be able to quickly pause the game while playing to quit.
a) Given that I am in-game, when I press the pause button, a menu should prompt the user to change settings or quit the game and return to the main menu.

b) Given that I am in game, when I look at the top left corner of the screen, I should see a pause button, and when I press the pause button, then a menu should open with a button that says “quit”, and when I press the button, I should return to the main menu, and all progress from the level should be lost.

c) Given that I am in game, and there are many obstacles, junk parts, and junkyard dogs on screen, when I look at the top left of the  screen, I should still be able to see the pause button, and when I press the pause button, I should see a button that says “quit”, and when I press the quit button, I should return to the main menu, and all level progress from the level should be lost.

### As a player in game, I want to be able to jump to the next platform, so that I can collect coffee. 
a) Given that I am on a platform, when a new platform appears, I should be able to reach it from the previously generated platform.
